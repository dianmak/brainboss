              You have dreams and goals - things you want to accomplish in life
              - but as time goes by...
              <strong>
                all you've done is mastered the art of sitting on your as*.
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              You want reality to be different - whether thatâ€™s yourself, people
              in your life or the world - and use this as a reason to be
              unhappy.
            </p>
            <p>
              You believe you are intelligent... yet often feel as if you don't
              know your own mind and it's working against you.
            </p>
